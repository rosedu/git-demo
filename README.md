git-demo
========

Git Repository for the Git Courses (CDL, OSSS, Webdev, D'Android). It is
better to have a single repository for demonstration purposes instead of
having multiple ones, created before the course is held and maybe deleted
afterwards.

Enforce that all participants have their name entered into `participants.md`
file by the end of the class.
